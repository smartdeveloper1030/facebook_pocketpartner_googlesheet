# Facebook Meta Ads Management Bot 🌟

Welcome to the Facebook Meta Ads Management Bot! This Python-based tool is designed to help users efficiently manage their Facebook Meta Ads by automating data collection and analysis.

## Overview

This bot collects key performance data, including **Commission** and **Spend**, from:

- [Pocket Partners](https://pocketpartners.com)

Using this data, the bot calculates the Return on Investment (ROI) for various ad locations. If the **ROI** falls below 150%, the bot automatically removes those locations from ad targeting.

## Key Features 💡

- **Automated Data Collection**: Seamlessly gathers key metrics from specified sources.
- **ROI Calculation**: Calculates ROI based on collected data to inform ad targeting decisions.
- **Cost Optimization**: Helps reduce ad costs while maintaining strong results.

## Impact 📉

Thanks to this bot, the company achieved an **8% reduction in ad costs** in target countries, all while keeping performance metrics strong!
